                After working with Unreal Engine for over 5 years, I became frustrated with the poor
                quality of the official documentation, so I decided to create my own open sourced
                documentation for it. Anyone with some knowledge of markdown and who wishes to
                contribute can submit documentation.

                Virtuverse is an RCE MMO-RPG set in a virtual world. A sort of sandbox-on-rails,
                Virtuverse allows players to specialise in different professions: crafting, mining,
                hunting, and many more; go on quests, ally or fight different factions, and explore
                the large and open worlds.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have worked on Virtuverse for more than four years along with a team of extremely
                talented developers and artists. Over the course of these four years, we have
                shipped more than 6 major updates and are currently working on the 7th, which is a
                complete rewrite in Unreal Engine 5.

                Terraforma is a 2D, hex-tile based game where the player controls an intricate
                network of plant roots and must restore the soil's thriving ecosystem. The game
                explores the nuances of soil science and underlines the importance of taking care of
                our planet and the environment.

                Columbia who finds himself in the midst of the next ice-age. Accompanied only by his
                dog Monty, he must survive the harsh wilderness before the oncoming storm makes him
                perish.

            I have worked with a number of clients on a variety of games, be it mobile, desktop,

            closely with the individual clients to ensure I can deliver exactly what they have

            In mid-2020 I took the lead responsibility of world level design, with primary
            responsibilities of natural and urban open world design. This, in combination with my
            experience in programming, allowed me to create dynamic, and in places procedural, maps
            that adapt to playerâ€™s behaviour.

            Over the more than four years as a developer at Virtuverse, I helped build a
            massively-multiplayer role-playing game. With such a task come huge challenges, and
            together with my team, we faced them head on by implementing a robust network
            architecture to facilitate thousands of users joining at once, designing a flexible user
            interface, and creating expansive and performant world maps.
